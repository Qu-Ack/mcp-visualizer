> Figma â€” but for Agentic Applications.

## ðŸ§  Why?

Agentic applications are new.  
Devs need better **mental models** to design, simulate, and understand them.

This is that tool.

## TODO:

- [ ] Design A fully oiled machine for adding nodes and leave room to add rules to the connections of those nodes or which nodes can be children of which nodes 


## ðŸš§ MVP Roadmap

- [ x ] Decide node types (`Model`, `Context`, `Protocol`)
- [ x ] Drag-and-drop UI system
- [ x ] Connect nodes visually
- [ ] Visual + UX feedback on connection logic
- [ ] Simulation panel
- [ ] Feedback from simulation
- [ ] Event logger panel
